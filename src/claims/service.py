"""Rule evaluation and notification submission.

This module owns the decision. It does not know it was reached over HTTP, which
is why it can be tested by calling a function with a typed object and asserting on
the result with no server running. It does not know where notifications are
stored either. It knows the rules.

`evaluate_policy_exists` ships written. It is the pattern every other rule
follows: take the notification and whatever it needs, decide, and return a
`ValidationOutcome` that names the rule and carries the values the decision was
made on. Nothing prints, nothing raises for an ordinary refusal, and nothing
reaches for a status code, because a status code is a fact about HTTP and this
module does not know about HTTP.

    This rule is different from the others in one way that matters: it is the only
    one that reaches outside the service, so it is the only one that can fail for
    a reason that is not the caller's fault. `PolicyNotFound` is caught here and
    turned into an ordinary refusal, because a policy that does not exist is a
    fact about the caller's data. `PolicyLookupFailed` is deliberately not caught,
    because the caller did nothing wrong and the HTTP layer has to be able to tell
    the two apart. Contract section 6 fixes what each becomes.

    V-1 short circuits. Every other rule compares against a field on a policy, and
    if there is no policy there is nothing to compare against. Reporting
    LOSS_BEFORE_INCEPTION for a policy number that does not exist is not merely
    unhelpful, it is a false statement about the client's data (WI-0142, AC-4).
